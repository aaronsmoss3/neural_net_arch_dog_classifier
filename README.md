# neural_net_arch_dog_classifier
Udacity course by-product on object-orient python code implementation of three neural nets classifiers

This was a fun intro project that focuses more on modular code then classifier construction. Always useful practice.

Run bash file for all three model architectures (vgg, alexnet, resnet):
> run_mdoel_batch.sh

Using calculate_stats.py and print_results.py to show/compare results of the three models

Outputs: 
> vgg_pet-images.txt /n
> alexnet_pet-images.txt /n
> resnet_pet-images.txt /n

VGG performed best at dog, nondog, breed, & label match.
